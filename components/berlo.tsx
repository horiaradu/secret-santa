        Defy the god of the dead and escape the Underworld.

        Winner of more than 50 Game of the Year awards, Hades is rogue-like
        hack-and-slash dungeon crawler, now available for the first time on
        PlayStation.

        Wield the powers and mythic weapons of Olympus to break free from the
        clutches of the god of the dead himself, while growing stronger and
        unravelling more of the story with each unique escape attempt.

        Aided by his extended family - that just so happen to include Zeus,
        Athena and other gods of Olympus - Zagreus&apos;s efforts are boosted
        with temporary buffs (known as Boons) that can be selected to suit your
        playstyle, and permanent upgrades that can be obtained during each
        play-through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hades combines the best aspects of Supergiant&apos;s critically
        acclaimed titles, including the fast-paced action of Bastion, the rich
        atmosphere and depth of Transistor, and the character-driven
        storytelling of Pyre.
