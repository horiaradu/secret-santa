        Cult of the Lamb casts players in the role of a possessed lamb saved
        from annihilation by an ominous stranger who must repay their debt by
        building a loyal following in his name. Start your own cult in a land of
        false prophets, venturing out into diverse and mysterious regions to
        build a loyal community of woodland worshippers and spread your Word to
        become the one true cult.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-lg">Build your flock</h4>
      <p>
        Collect and use resources to build new structures, perform dark rituals
        to appease the gods and give sermons to reinforce the faith of your
        flock.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-lg">Destroy the non-believers</h4>
      <p>
        Explore a sprawling, randomly generated world, fight off hordes of
        enemies and defeat rival cult leaders in order to absorb their power and
        assert your cult&apos;s dominance.
      </p>
      <h4 className="text-lg">Spread your word</h4>
      <p>
        Train your flock and embark on a quest to explore and discover the
        secrets of four mysterious regions. Cleanse the non-believers, spread
        enlightenment and perform mystical rituals on the journey to become the
        mighty lamb god.
